# A Quiet Kind of Love 🌙

A cinematic, mobile-first, single-page web experience designed as an intimate New Year message — blending emotional storytelling, ambient sound design, WebGL visuals, and subtle interaction.

This project explores how **quiet moments**, **gentle motion**, and **minimal UI** can create a deeply personal digital experience.
